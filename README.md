# IOT_workshop
## Overview
Student repository for a workshop on the Internet of Things. 
This is a 2 day workshop that introduces students to using the ESP32 and micropython to create Internet of Things (IOT) devices.
## Hardware
For simplicity, we'll be using an ESP32 kit containing a variety of sensors, LED's, switches, and other stuff. We won't use all of the kit components in this workshop, but students will be able to explore using the other components on their own. This is the stuff we're using for the workshop. If you're in the workshop, all of this will be provided - it's just listed here for your information.

There are other kits available, some much larger than this one. Any ESP32 kit will do.

[half breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LFD4LT6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) One thing about this kit (and others) are that they use a standard breadboard. I find it convenient to put two breadboards together and plug the ESP32 into them, since most ESP32 boards are too wide for a single breadboard. This link has enough breadboards for 3 kits.

[breadboard wires](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M2GH5HG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)You also might want some additional breadboard wires (although any solid 22gauge wire will do in a pinch). This link has enough wires for 3 kits.

Any WS2812B compatible LED will work - this one isn't special.
