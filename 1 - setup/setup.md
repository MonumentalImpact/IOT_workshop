# Setup

## Install Thonny on the host computer
For the workshop computers, this will already be done. If you have your own computer, go to [thonny.org](https://thonny.org/) and download/install thonny. It's a free python development environment that's easy to use and has built-in support for micropython and microcontrollers like the ESP32 that we'll be using.

## Getting acquainted with the kit

## Flashing micropython
We use thonny to install micropython on the esp32, but first you have to download the micropython binary file from [micropython.org](https://www.micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC/). Download the latest .bin file under "Firmware" on that page.
